# Improved-detection-of-fraud-cases-for-e-commerce-and-bank-transactions
Fraud detection is a critical component of financial technology, particularly in the e-commerce and banking sectors, where the risk of fraudulent activity is ever-present. As transactions increasingly shift to online platforms, financial institutions and e-commerce businesses face significant challenges in preventing financial fraud. Fraudulent transactions can result in financial losses, compromised data security, and diminished customer trust.

### Project Overview

This fraud detection project seeks to accomplish key objectives that reflect Adey Innovations' commitment to ensuring secure financial technology. The goals include

**Developing Precise Fraud Detection Models**
**Analyzing Geolocation Data**
**Identifying Transaction Patterns**


1. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing:**

    Examine historical transaction data to detect patterns and anomalies.
Prepare and preprocess the data by addressing missing values, handling outliers, and standardizing features for optimal model training.

2. **Feature Engineering:**

    -Develop features that highlight key indicators, including transaction frequency, amount fluctuations, geolocation inconsistencies, and historical transaction comparisons.
Engineer new features based on time, location, and user behavior to enhance pattern recognition and fraud detection.

3. **Model Building and Evaluation:**

    -Implement machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting to develop predictive models.
Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure effective fraud detection while reducing false positives.

4. **Explainability:**

    - use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to explain model decisions
